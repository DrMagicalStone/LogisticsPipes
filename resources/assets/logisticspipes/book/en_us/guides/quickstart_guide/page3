You might be asking where the Mk2 and Mk3 pipes and modules are. They are gone, but you can recreate their effects by adding upgrades to your pipes and modules. Those upgrades are named 'Action Speed', 'Item Extraction' or 'ItemStack Extraction'.
To upgrade your modules, you need an upgrade for your chassis pipe called the 'Module Upgrade'. After applying it to your chassis pipe, new slots appear to the right of every inserted module. That's where the upgrades for the module go.
