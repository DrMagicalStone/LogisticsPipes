The Logistics Programmer is an item that wont be used up in any crafting recipes, but you need to set it up first. That is to be done with a Logistics Program Compiler. I know, I know, it sounds complicated. But it really isn't. Craft both of these and a Logistics Disk.
Now you place the Logistics Program Compiler (further just compiler) next to a Logistics Basic Pipe that is - by other pipes or directly - connected to the Power Junction, because the compiler needs power and will take that from the LP network.
