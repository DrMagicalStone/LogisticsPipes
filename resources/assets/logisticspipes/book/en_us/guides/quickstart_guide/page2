The compiler can be used to research new tiers, pipes, modules and upgrades. Insert the Logistics Disk on the top left. Then you are able to unlock different tiers. Let's start with 'Basic'. Researching takes some time, so relax and get some coffee.
After unlocking a tier, you should be able to see the different pipe, module or upgrade names on the right. You can now compile each of these, which takes a shorter amount of time. Compiling makes those programs flashable onto the Logistics Programmer.
To flash a program, simply insert the Logistics Programmer into the top right slot and flash one of those programs onto the programmer. Afterwards you can use this programmer in the crafting of that item. Module programs can be found within the chassis tiers.
